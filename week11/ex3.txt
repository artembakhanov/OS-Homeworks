The first program prints "Hello" twice because printf is line buffered and executing fork() new exact dublicate is created. Buffer is also included there.
Since both proccesses have "Hello" in their buffers it is printed out twice.
In the second program buffer is flushed before forking. So just Hello and two empty lines will be printed out.
